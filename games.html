  <h2>Traditional Games of Tamil Nadu</h2>
<p align="justify" class="style9">The name "traditional games" appeared as a derivative of the concept of "traditional lifestyles", and is an integrant of the concepts of "traditional culture" and "traditional holidays". Traditional games are held as part of the rituals and holidays of the traditional national calendar or traditional holidays, which are confined to the lunar and solar cycle and agricultural events throughout the year. Therefore, they fall under the same time frame for the majority of peoples dwelling in similar landscape and climatic zones. For the same reason, any attempts to move the dates of the traditional games are meaningless, because you cannot possibly have Shrovetide in December or July, Sabantuy in November or April, or Nowruz in September or January.</p>

    <h3>1. Kabadi</h3>
    <p align="justify" class="style10"> Kabaddi is a contact team sport. Played between two teams of seven players, the objective of the game is for a single player on offence, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of a court, tag out as many of their defenders as possible, and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders, and in a single breath. Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are tagged or tackled, but are brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle.</p>

    <h3>4. Rekla</h3>
    <p align="justify" class="style10"> Both bull and rider are conditioned for years, before they are ready for a rekla (bullock-cart) race. I've been rearing bullocks for the race for over twenty years now. I had a different name while in government service. After I retired though, I have taken on a different name. When my bulls win they race, they say, "Nagarampatti Vaiththiyar's bulls have won.” The area around Theni, where hills abound, is called Varshanadu. There are frequent rains. The cattle roams free on the hills, drinking that water, breathing in that air. They are guided by herders and protected from wolves. They are not tame. You will be gored if you go near. We call this breed the naattu inam (local breed). We take calves from this breed for the rekla race, and for our ploughs and transport.</p>

    <h3>5. Kilithattu</h3>
    <p align="justify" class="style10"> A game that requires quick reflexes, tactical thinking and tremendous team effort. This sport is a part of our Tamil heritage and preserves our Tamil identity. The ‘kili’ or last player must stand on the centre of the first lane when the game starts. The ‘kili’ player can move anywhere around the court or through the middle of the court but not horizontally. The team that is guarding the base and capturing it is chosen by a coin toss. The game is started by a whistle sound by the overseeing referee. When the game starts, each of the other members can only move sideways/horizontally. This accounts for the rest of the 5 members of the team for a total of 6 including ‘kili’.</p>
